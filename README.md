# TTA Python Projects
Practice projects from The Tech Academy's Python course.

#### Hotel Menu Django Project
The Hotel Menu Django project involved creating menu items for a mock hotel. We were able to practice Python and Django concepts, the main one being Django's architectural design pattern of Model, View, and Template.

#### GUI and Tkinter Project Drill
The graphical user interface and tkinter three-part drill involved creating a GUI that allowed users to select a source directory and a destination directory to transfer .txt files, record the file names that were moved and their corresponding modified time-stamps into a database, and print out those text files and their modified time-stamps to the console.

#### Database and Sqlite3 Project Drill
The database drill involved writing a script that creates a database and adds new data into that database.

#### OS Module Project Drill
The OS module drill involved writing a script that checks a specific folder on the hard drive, verify whether those files end with a “.txt” file extension and if they do, print those qualifying file names and their corresponding modified time-stamps to the console.
