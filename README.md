## Royal Hotels Menu
This Python project involved using the Django framework to implement the ability to create menu items from the front end and from the back end for our mock hotel.

## GUI and Tkinter Project
This Python three-part project involved using Tkinter and the sqlite3 and OS modules to create a graphical user interface that allows a user to select a source directory and a destination directory to transfer .txt files, record the file names that were moved and their corresponding modified time-stamps into a database, and print out those text files and their modified time-stamps to the console.

## Database and Sqlite3 Project
This Python project involved using the sqlite3 module to write a script that creates a database and adds new data into that database.

## OS Module Project
This Python project involved using the OS module to write a script that checks a specific folder on the hard drive, verify whether those files end with a “.txt” file extension and if they do, print those qualifying file names and their corresponding modified time-stamps to the console.
